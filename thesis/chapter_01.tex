Generally speaking, the introduction chapter should introduce the 
topic of the thesis and motivate the importance of it. Moreover, the
introduction should give an outline of the thesis and point out the 
contributions of this work.

You can logically group the chapters of the thesis
by using so-called parts. An example of how to insert a part-page 
containing a teaser-image is included in this template.
Typically, you will have an introductory chapter that gives a
broad overview. Then, the first part of the thesis might start after 
the introduction.
