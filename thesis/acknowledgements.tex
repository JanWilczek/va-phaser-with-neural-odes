%\section*{Acknowledgements}
First and foremost, the biggest thanks goes to my supervisor and mentor, prof. dr. ir. Emanu{\"e}l Habets. Your guidance, supportive attitude, belief in me, and eagerness to open various academic and industrial possibilities for me have significantly impacted my career and life path. I cannot thank you enough.

I would like to express my gratitude to prof. Vesa V{\"a}lim{\"a}ki and Alec Wright for hosting me at the Aalto University in Espoo, Finland and supervising this thesis. Your ideas and guidance are the main reason behind the results of this work. Additionally, I would like to thank the members of the Aalto Acoustics Lab, especially Eloi Moliner and Michael McCrea for particularly fruitful conversations.

Finally, I express my deepest gratitude to my parents, who supported me in various ways, not only during the thesis research but during the whole course of the Master's degree.

This work was supported by a
fellowship within the IFI programme of the German Academic Exchange
Service (DAAD).
