%\section*{Abstract}
Virtual Analog modeling is the science of imitating analog systems with digital ones. It allows for obtaining vintage sound of expensive or no longer manufactured equipment by means of software implementation. Analog systems, such as analog electronic circuits, are often described as state-space models governed by a system of ordinary differential equations. Traditionally, deep learning was used to map an input-to-output mapping. After the introduction of residual networks, which learn the residual of the mapping rather than the full mapping,  the domains of neural networks and ordinary differential equations started to overlap. Recent developments suggest that neural networks are capable of learning the derivative of a dynamical system. The learned derivative may be supplied to a numerical solver of choice to compute the actual system output in response to an input signal. In this work, an application of this concept to Virtual Analog modeling is presented with a focus on two specific audio effects: a diode clipper (distortion) circuit and a phaser pedal.
