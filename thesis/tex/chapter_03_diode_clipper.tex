\chapter{Diode Clipper}
\label{chap:diode_clipper}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The aim of this work is to investigate the applicability of the ODENet architecture to \ac{VA} modeling of audio effects. The main goal is to model a phaser pedal. However, in order to get intuition behind this type of architecture, a simpler, time-invariant system was modeled, namely, a first-order diode clipper. This chapter describes this system, its modeling and obtained results. The next chapter deals with the phaser in a similar manner.

\section{Diode Clipper Circuit}
\label{subsec:diode_clipper_intro}

\end{figure}

The first-order diode clipper is a circuit frequently used to achieve signal distortion, e.\ g. in guitar amplifiers. Its schematic is shown on \Figure{fig:diode_clipper_circuit}. It can be regarded as consisting of two parts: an RC lowpass filter and a diode limiter.

Voltages and currents in this section are dependent on time, i.\ e., $V = V(t), I= I(t)$. For readability, this dependence is not stated explicitly in the equations.

\subsection*{RC Lowpass Filter}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{figures/tikz/rc_lowpass.tex}
  \caption{RC lowpass filter.}
  \label{fig:rc_lowpass}
\end{figure}

The first part of the diode clipper circuit is an RC lowpass filter. An RC lowpass filter is shown in \Figure{fig:rc_lowpass}. Given that the input voltage $V_{in}$ is a sine wave at frequency $f$, the input-output voltage relation is governed by the following equation
\begin{equation}
  V_{out} = \frac{X_C}{\sqrt{R^2 + X_C^2}} V_{in},
  \label{eq:rc_circuit}
\end{equation}
where $V_{out}$ is the output voltage, $X_C=\frac{1}{2\pi f C}$ is the capacitive reactance of the capacitor in the circuit, $C$ is its capacitance, $R$ is the resistor's resistance.

The capacitor impedes low frequencies more; the lower the frequency, the higher the capacitive reactance. More capacitive reactance means larger voltage drop on the capacitor. Thus, assuming a constant magnitude across all frequencies of the input voltage, the output voltage is higher for low frequencies and the circuit behaves like a lowpass filter.

Considering an arbitrary input waveform, we may derive a differential equation that describes the circuit \cite{Horowitz2015}. The current $I$ through the capacitor is proportional to the rate of change of the voltage across it

\begin{equation}
  I = C \frac{\mathrm{d}V_{out}}{\mathrm{d} t}.
  \label{eq:current_through_capacitor}
\end{equation}

The current flowing through the resistor can be calculated using the Ohm's law as a ratio of the voltage drop across the resistor to its resistance

\begin{equation}
  I = \frac{V_{in} - V_{out}}{R}.
  \label{eq:current_through_resistor}
\end{equation}

Because the same current flows through the resistor and the capacitor we can equate the right-hand sides of \Equation{eq:current_through_capacitor} and \Equation{eq:current_through_resistor}. After dividing by $C$, we obtain the final form of the \ac{ODE} describing the RC circuit

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\mathrm{d}V_{out}}{\mathrm{d} t} = \frac{V_{in} - V_{out}}{RC}.
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Diode Limiter}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{figures/tikz/diode_limiter.tex}
  \caption{Diode limiter circuit.}
  \label{fig:diode_limiter}
\end{figure}

The second part of the diode clipper is the diode limiter also called a \emph{diode clamp} \cite{Malvino2016}. Its circuit is shown in \Figure{fig:diode_limiter}. It consists of two inversely polarized diodes and a resistor. This circuit could be further divided into a \emph{positive clipper} (by removing the diode on the left) and a \emph{negative clipper} (by removing the diode on the right). These names refer to which part of the input \ac{AC} signal (the positive or the negative) is removed at the output.

If the diodes were ideal, i.\ e., they would behave as an open for voltages across smaller than 0 and as a short for voltages across larger than 0, $V_{out}$ would always be 0. However, to a second approximation, the diodes cause a voltage drop of \SI{0.7}{V} when conducting. Thus, the voltage cannot exceed the \SIrange{-0.7}{0.7}{V} range, being clamped when attempting to do so. The positive clipper guards the upper limit and the negative clipper guards the lower limit. The effect of passing an \ac{AC} signal through the diode limiter is shown in \Figure{fig:diode_limiter_signal}.

\cite{Yeh2007} contains the small-signal interpretation of the diode limiter circuit.

  \caption{Impact of the diode limiter on the input sinusoidal voltage. Values that exceed the \SIrange{-0.7}{0.7}{V} range are clamped and the signal is distorted.}
  \label{fig:diode_limiter_signal}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{First-Order Diode Clipper}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Combining the RC lowpass filter (\Figure{fig:rc_lowpass}) and the diode limiter (\Figure{fig:diode_limiter}) yields the first-order diode clipper (\Figure{fig:diode_clipper_circuit}). It is called "first-order" because only a single capacitor is used \cite{Parker2019}. If the input voltage is within the limiter's operational range, the circuit acts as a lowpass filter. If the voltage exceeds this range, it is clipped at the output and distortion is introduced.

The first-order diode clipper can be described by a nonlinear \ac{ODE} \cite{Yeh2007}
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\mathrm{d} V_{out}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{V_{in} - V_{out}}{RC} - 2 \frac{I_s}{C} \sinh \left(\frac{V_{out}}{V_t}\right),
\end{equation}
where $V_{in}$ is the input voltage, $V_{out}$ is the output voltage, $t$ denotes time, $R$ is the serial resistance, $C$ is the parallel capacity, $I_s$ is the reverse saturation current, and $V_t$ is the thermal voltage. The last two are parameters of the diodes and can be extracted from measurement \cite{Yeh2007}.

The parameter values of discrete elements used in the experiments were taken from \cite{Yeh2008}. They are summarized in \Table{tab:diode_clipper_element_parameters}.

\begin{table}

  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}

    Parameter & Value \\

    $R$ & \SI{2.2}{k\ohm} \\
    $C$ & \SI{10}{nF} \\
    $I_s$ & \SI{2.52}{nA} \\
    $V_t$ & \SI{45.3}{mV} \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab:diode_clipper_element_parameters}
\end{table}

$V_{in}$ is typically on the order of volts.

\section{Relation to Other Work}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The first-order diode clipper is a system particularly interesting in the context of the ODENet, because it is governed by a known \ac{ODE} \cite{Yeh2007,Yeh2008}. Additionally, it was already modeled using a \ac{ResNet} type of architecture in \cite{Parker2019}. Thus, learning to imitate the diode clipper allowed for validation of the ODENet and comparison to 
\begin{itemize}
    \item an \ac{LSTM} architecture from \cite{Wrightetal2020},
    \item a \ac{ResNet}-like architecture from \cite{Parker2019}, and
    \item a numerical solution using the \ac{ODE} from \cite{Yeh2007,Yeh2008}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Training Data}
\label{sec:diode_clipper_training_data}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The dataset to be used for the diode clipper modeling consisted of 7 minutes and 59 seconds of guitar and bass recordings from \cite{Abesser2013} and \cite{Kehling2014} respectively. The amount of guitar recordings was roughly the same as the amount of bass recordings and their ordering was arbitrary. All recordings were single-channel and used \SI{44100}{Hz} sampling rate. 1 minute and 29 seconds (approximately 20\%) of these were used as the test set. Care was taken so that the test file begins with silence. The remaining data was split into the validation set (1 minute and 18 seconds) and the train set (5 minutes and 12 seconds) according to the 80:20 rule. The input were raw recordings and the target distorted signal was synthesized from a SPICE model of the circuit with the schematic from \Figure{fig:diode_clipper_circuit} and parameter values from \Table{tab:diode_clipper_element_parameters}. For the simulation, LTspice XVII by Analog Devices was used \cite{LTspice}. The synthesized target data sounds realistically and was previously used with success in \cite{Wright2019}.

The proper training set was split into half-second segments. These segments were randomly shuffled at the beginning of each epoch and split into minibatches of a predetermined size. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Training}
\label{sec:diode_clipper_training}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The training procedure was as follows. Firstly, the dataset was loaded, then the network architecture was initialized, and the training parameters were set (optimization algorithm, hyperparameters, learning rate schedule, loss function). Then the proper training was run for a fixed number of epochs. After each epoch, the validation loss was computed. Finally, after finishing the last epoch, the test set was processed and the model's output along with the final loss value were recorded.

A single epoch consisted of processing the minibatches of segments in chunks (subsegments) of a given length. After each subsegment, the gradient of the loss with respect to the network parameters was calculated using the \ac{BPTT}. Then, the gradient step was performed using the optimizer, the computation graph discarded and the next subsegment processed. After each minibatch, the learning rate scheduler performed its step (if such a scheduler was set). When an epoch has ended, model parameters were stored by overwriting the previously saved ones. Additionally, the training session kept track of the model which performed best on the validation set.
