%% Presentation conclusions:
% ODENet architecture can learn the ODE governing an analog audio effect.
% ODENet cannot produce aliasing unless it is present in the training data; no need for oversampling.
% The learned derivative can be used at sampling rates higher than the training sampling rate.
% ODENet can provide results comparable to traditional recurrent neural networks (like LSTM) yet using a smaller number of parameters.
% Solver choice is not that important; derivative network treatment is.

The aim of this work was to investigate whether the ODENet framework--teaching a neural network the \ac{ODE} that governs a system and then supplying it to a numerical solver of choice--is can be used for \ac{VA} modeling. If the answer was positive, possible advantages and disadvantages in comparison to other modeling methods were to be considered.
