The aim of this work is to model analog audio effects using an \ac{ODE}-inspired approach to deep learning. This part of the thesis presents the theoretical background concerning these fields in the scope relevant for this work. 

In this chapter, in \Section{section:ode}, the \acp{ODE} are presented with a brief description of numerical methods used to solve them. In \Section{section:deep_learning}, the tools and methods from deep learning relevant for this thesis are presented. Finally, in the next chapter, the general concept of \ac{VA} modeling is presented.
