The aim of the thesis is to model analog audio effects using an \ac{ODE}-inspired approach to deep learning. This chapter presents the theoretical background concerning these fields in the scope relevant for this work. 

In \Section{section:ode}, the \acp{ODE} are presented with a brief description of numerical methods used to solve them. In \Section{section:deep_learning}, the tools and methods from deep learning relevant for this thesis are presented. Finally, in \Section{section:virtual_analog_modeling}, the general concept of \ac{VA} modeling is presented.

\Ac{VA} effects are digital emulations of audio systems that were originally built using analog electronic or electromechanical components \cite{Zoelzer2011}. They arose out of the demand for the reproduction of characteristic tonal distortions of these devices but with the digital stability and the ease of integration with existing software. Devices modelled range from filters, to time-varying effects, amplifiers, mechanical reverb units, and tape or vinyl distortions.

One can distinguish three general approaches to \ac{VA} modeling \cite{Kiiski2016,Wright2020}. In \emph{black-box} modelling, only the input-output relation of a system is examined and a signal model is constructed to mimic that behavior. Neural networks have successfully been applied to this kind of modeling for guitar amplifiers \cite{Wright2019,Wrightetal2020}. In \emph{white-box} modelling an internal structure of the system under study is examined and used to construct an algorithm aiming at reproducing its behavior. Sometimes it is referred to as \emph{physical modeling}. Typical approaches in this category are a numerical solution of \acp{ODE} derived from electronic circuit analysis \cite{Yeh2007,Eichas2014} or wave-digital filters \cite{PASPWEB2010}. \emph{Grey-box} modeling falls somewhere in between the two already mentioned approaches, where we use some knowledge about the inner workings of the device under study to design a model and, subsequently, take advantage of the input and output data to adjust the model's parameters. This approach has been successfully applied to time-varying effects modeling, like a phaser or a flanger \cite{Kiiski2016,Wright2020}, where a \ac{LFO} signal is estimated and used for conditioning the model.
