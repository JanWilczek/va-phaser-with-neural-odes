Phaser is a filter-based, time-varying effect \cite{Zoelzer2011}. It applies a series of notches to the spectrum of the input signal. The center frequencies of these notches are controlled by a \ac{LFO} and constantly vary with respect to one another, each moving up and down the frequency range. The time-varying notches create a "swooshing" sound that is often identified as "robotic" in sound.

Phaser should not be confused with another notch-sweeping effect, namely, flanger. Flanging differs from phasing in that the time-varying notches are equally-spaced and infinite in number (limited only by the sampling rate). The notches are created by summing the direct path with an output of a variable-length delay line, whose length is controlled by an \ac{LFO}. The result is a time-varying comb filter. Its sound is often compared to a jet taking off.

Phaser is typically implemented by summing the input signal processed by a series of notch or allpass filters with a direct path \cite{Zoelzer2011}. Additionally, a feedback connection can be added around the filter chain \cite{Kiiski2016}. The feedback connection makes the phaser behavior more complex by introducing resonances and non-notch frequency boosting.
