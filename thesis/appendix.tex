In this chapter, the headers of selected \MATLAB{} functions created during the writing of this thesis are reproduced. The headers contain information about the name of the described function and its input/output behavior.

\section*{Feature Extraction}
The \texttt{file\_to\_feature} function is used as a wrapper for several low-level functions that perform feature extraction or loading of precomputed features.

Sample usage:\\
\scriptsize
\verb|[f_pitch, f_peaks] = file_to_feature('features', 'pathetique.wav');|

% Name: file_to_feature
% Version: 1.0
% Date: 11.05.2010
% Programmer: John Q. Public
%
% Description:
%   Load or compute features for audio and MIDI files
%
% Input:
% - dirname: Directory where the file or features are located
% - filename: Name of the file for which to load/compute features
% - parameter
%            .win_len: Window length used for STMSP feature generation
%            .win_res: Window resolution
%
% Output:
% - f_pitch: Pitch features (STMSP)
% - f_peaks: Energy peaks for onset computation
% - f_onsets: Precise onsets (only generated in case of MIDI input data)
